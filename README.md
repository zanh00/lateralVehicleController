# lateralVehicleController

This repo contains MPC controller for lateral vehicle control - part of the GenesisProject. It contains Simulink model as well as Matlab initialization and simulation scripts. Generated code is inside _Code_ folder.

"LateralController0_ert_rtw" is the directory where the code will be generated by Simulink. Move the usefull files from there to "Code" directory manualy, since the original directory is ignored by git since a lot of junk is generated alongside the code.
